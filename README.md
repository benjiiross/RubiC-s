# RubiC-s

## Description

This is a recreation of a rubiks cube in C language.

It uses a CLI to display the cube and to interact with it.

We used [conio.h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conio.h) to get the input from the user and to add vibrant colors.

We added many different features to the cube, like:

- **Filling the cube** with a random pattern of colors, checking if the cube is solvable or not.
- **Solving the cube** with a simple algorithm that we created.
- **Scrambling the cube** with a random number of moves.
- **Playing a game** with the cube, where you have to solve it.
- **Speedcubing** with the cube, where you have to solve it as fast as possible.

Feel free to use it and try to solve it!
